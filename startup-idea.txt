🚘 Startup Idea Recap: Garage Marketplace App
🧩 The Problem:
In Tunisia, many small garages don’t have an online presence.

Car owners often don’t know which garage is reliable, affordable, or close.

Trust issues and lack of service visibility limit both sides.

Manual discovery wastes time and limits options for car repairs and maintenance.

💡 The Solution:
A mobile and web marketplace that connects car owners with nearby garages.
Car owners can:

Discover garages by location, service, reviews, price

Book appointments

Track their car’s service history

Garages can:

Manage appointments

Get more clients

Build an online presence

Handle simple operations (e.g., record jobs, customer notes)

📱 Mobile App Features (for Car Owners)
🚗 User Side (Client)
Register/Login

Add Vehicle(s) to a profile (plate number, model, year, etc.)

Garage Discovery (by location, rating, availability, service type)

Book a Service (date, time, problem description)

Live Chat with the garage (optional)

View Booking History & notifications

Leave Reviews & Ratings

Push Notifications (reminders, updates)

Upload car photos or problems (optional)

🔧 Garage Side (Mechanic)
Register/Login + KYC

Create Garage Profile (location, services, hours, photos, etc.)

See Incoming Bookings

Accept/Decline Appointments

Manage Calendar & Availability

Customer Chat

Dashboard: Revenue, jobs completed, customer reviews

Update Job Status (pending, in progress, completed)

Optional: Mark No-shows

💻 Web Application Features (Admin + Garage View)
🧑‍💼 Admin Panel
Garage Approval & Verification

User Management

Support Tickets / Complaints

Booking Statistics

Reported Users/Garages

Commission Reports & Payments

Marketing tools (push notifications, emails)

🔧 Web Portal for Garages (optional)
Same features as mobile, plus:

Invoice Downloads

Printable Reports

Detailed Booking Management

💰 Monetization Strategy
Commission per Booking (e.g., 10% from the garage)

Premium Listing for garages to show up first

In-app Ads (optional)

Car Maintenance Subscriptions (long-term)

🚀 MVP Suggestion (Minimum Viable Product)
To launch faster:

Focus on client mobile app + basic garage panel (mobile).

Admin panel can be minimal at first (for garage verification + bookings monitoring).

Add web portal and advanced features later.


TECH STACK

Explanation of the Recommended Tech Stack

Frontend (Mobile App - Flutter)
Flutter: A framework that allows you to build cross-platform apps (Android & iOS) from a single codebase. Since you already know Flutter, this will be your primary tool for building the user-side and garage-side mobile apps.
Riverpod (State Management): Helps manage the state of your app (e.g., whether a booking is confirmed, pending, etc.). It simplifies the way you handle complex interactions between UI components.
Dio (Networking): A powerful HTTP client for Flutter. You'll use it to interact with your backend API for tasks like fetching garages, booking appointments, or leaving reviews.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (Push Notifications): Allows you to send notifications to users (e.g., reminders for car maintenance or booking confirmations).
Google Maps Flutter: Enables map-based services like garage discovery based on location.

Backend (API + Server Logic - NestJS)
NestJS: A framework for building scalable server-side applications using JavaScript/TypeScript. It's structured and modular, making it easier to grow your app.
Example: When a user books a service, NestJS will handle the logic to store the booking in the database and notify the garage.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript with additional features like static typing, making your code safer and easier to debug.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format. Perfect for storing dynamic data like user profiles, bookings, and reviews.
Example: You can store data like { userId: "123", car: "Toyota Corolla", bookingStatus: "Pending" }.
JWT (Authentication): JSON Web Tokens are used to securely authenticate users. When someone logs in, they'll receive a token to prove their identity on subsequent requests.

Hosting & Infrastructure
Railway/Render: Cloud platforms for hosting your backend. They simplify deployment, meaning you can get your backend online with minimal configuration.
MongoDB Atlas: A cloud-hosted version of MongoDB that takes care of database scaling and backups for you.
Firebase Storage: Used to store user-uploaded images, like car problem photos or garage pictures.

DevOps & Continuous Integration/Delivery
CI/CD (GitHub Actions): Automates tasks like testing and deploying your code whenever you make changes. Saves time and ensures everything runs smoothly before it goes live.
Codemagic: Specifically for Flutter apps, it helps automate builds and deploy mobile apps to the Play Store or App Store.
Monitoring & Analytics
Sentry: Tracks bugs and errors in your app. If something breaks, you’ll know exactly where and why.
Firebase Analytics: Lets you track user behavior (e.g., how users interact with the garage discovery feature).

Other Tools
Redis: A caching tool that speeds up frequently accessed data, like a list of garages in a city.
Twilio/SMS Gateway: Sends SMS notifications to users, such as booking reminders (optional).
How the GitHub Student Pack Can Help
The GitHub Student Pack includes free or discounted access to many tools and services. Here's what you can use to reduce costs:

MongoDB Atlas: The Student Pack includes a free $100 credit for MongoDB Atlas. This will help you run your database for free during the early stages.
Heroku: While I recommended Railway/Render, the pack offers free Heroku credits, which you can also use to host your backend.
Sentry: Use the free tier to monitor your app for errors.
Namecheap: Get a free domain name for your project for one year.
DigitalOcean: $100 in free credits that you can use for backend hosting if you want more flexibility.
Bootstrap Studio: While not directly relevant for Flutter, this could help if you ever work on a web version of the app.
Canva: Use it to create marketing assets for your app launch.
